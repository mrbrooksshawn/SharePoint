***DON'T use TODAY in the calculation below... use NOW***

Calculated Column 1: Determine Today's Month and Year
1.Create a calculated column
2.Name the column Current MM-YY
3.In the formula field, type the following: =Text(NOW(),"MM-YY")
4.The "Single line of text" radio button should be selected
5.If applicable, the "Add to all content types" box should be unchecked.
6.If applicable, the "Add to default view" box should be unchecked.



Calculated Column 2: Determine the Month and Year of a User Provided Date
1.Create another calculated column
2.Name the column Effective MM-YY
1.For my list, the Effective Date is a date provided by the user.
2.I will show you how to modify this if you want to use the system generated Created or Modified date instead.
3.In the formula field, type the following: =Text[Effective Date],"MM-YY")
4.The "Single line of text" radio button should be selected
5.If applicable, the "Add to all content types" box should be unchecked.
6.If applicable, the "Add to default view" box should be unchecked.


Calculated Column 3: Determine If List Item is Same as Month & Year of Current Month & Year
1.Create your last calculated column
2.Name the column Current Month Data?
3.In the formula field, type the following: =[Current MM-YY]=[Effective Date MM-YY]
4.The "Yes/No" radio button should be selected.
5.If applicable, the "Add to all content types" box should be unchecked.
6.If applicable, the "Add to default view" box should be unchecked.


Create Your Custom View

 1. Create a new view and name it Current Month's Data
 2. In the Filter section, select the "Show items only when the following is true:" radio button.
 3. Select "Current Month Data?" from the first combo box.
 4. Select "is equal to" from the second combo box.
 5. Type the word "YES" in the text field.


You will now have a view that it is ALWAYS filtered to show the current month's data!


How to Use this with the Created or Modified Date as the Effective Date

 In this example, I am filtering based upon a user provided date.
 If you want your filter to apply to the system generated Created date or Modified date, take the following action:

1.Create Calculated Column 1 as-is.
2.Create Calculated Column 2 with a modified formula.
To use the Created date in place of Effective Date, name the column Created MM-YY and use the following formula. Make everything else like I described in the Column 2 instructions above.
